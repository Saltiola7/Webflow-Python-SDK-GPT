# Webflow-Python-SDK-GPT
This [CustomGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7uWCYgFAo-webflow-python-sdk-assistant
) is trained with the documentation within the offical [Webflow Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/webflow), learn more here

)


If there are any issues, file issue here so I can update the GPT accordingly

To access the most up to date documentation using python, use the code in [generate_documentation.py](https://github.com/Saltiola7/Webflow-Python-SDK-GPT/blob/main/generate_documentation.py) to generate a markdown file.

I created this as there was no clear documentation to the SDK and I had to figure out how to print it out from the python library itself.
